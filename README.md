##  pV Solar Power Plant:


### Photo Voltaic Solar Power has emerged as the best source of green energy in recent past in a country like India which gets a good amount of solar insolation. With the continuous development of efficient PV modules, Battery storage and Smart Grid etc. Power Generation through PV Solar Plant has gained the momentum further and has a very promising future.

### The solar power plant is also known as the Photovoltaic (PV) power plant. It is a large-scale PV plant designed to produce bulk electrical power from solar radiation. The solar power plant uses solar energy to produce electrical power. Therefore, it is a conventional power plant.Solar energy can be used directly to produce electrical energy using solar PV panels.Hence, to produce electrical power on a large scale, solar PV panels are used. Below is the layout plan of photovoltaic power plant.
